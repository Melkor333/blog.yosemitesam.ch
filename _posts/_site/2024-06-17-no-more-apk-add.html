<p>Who doesn’t know something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Just to then be able to specify somewhere in your CI</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>make
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> is just an example, but I often see containers with only one or two packages added.</p>

<p>These kinds of containers are usually used for a simple build step.</p>

<p>There are 2 typical approaches which both have their downside:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I use a Containerfile as above to generate an image</li>
</ul>

<p>This means I need to build a container &amp; upload it to a registry first.</p>

<p>Building docker images in a CI is not always trivial (though it’s gotten better) and requires a bit of extra effort like an extra build/upload step in the CI, a registry I can upload it to, secrets to authenticate against the registry…</p>
<ul>
  <li>I run the command directly in the CI.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has to run every time the CI runs - which means a lot of unnecessary compute &amp; wait time!</p>

<p>But given that the previous solution requires a bit of time to set up, this is the “lets’ get it done quickly” approach often taken</p>

<p>Now let me introduce to you another way to solve this small annoyance.</p>

<h1 id="nixery">Nixery</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tazjin/nixery">Nixery</a> is a “container registry” which can produce a minimal container image with only the packages you need. For example when I pull the image <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nixery.dev/bash/gnumake/musl</code> it will generate an image with the 3 specified packages <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gnumake</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">musl</code> ad-hoc. The packages are built from <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</a> and copied into the container including their own dependencies. This is done <em>on the server</em> at “pulltime”. That means all I do is specify the above container to pull and I don’t need any extra step.</p>

<p>So an example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gitlab-ci</code> task which I actually used to run an install step which just copies files into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install</code> directory to be packaged in a later phase:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>build:
  stage: install
  image: nixery.dev/bash/gnumake/musl
  script:
    - make install
  artifacts:
    untracked: false
    paths:
      - install

...

stages:
  - install
  - package
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What packages can I use that way? <strong>MANY</strong>! According to <a href="https://repology.org/repositories/graphs">repology</a> it’s the repository with <em>by far</em> the most packages. There’s also a <a href="https://search.nixos.org/packages?">search</a> where you can check if a package you require in your container is available (and how it’s called).</p>

<p>And if you’re a bit of a nerd; it’s not even <em>that</em> hard to add a new package <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs">to the nixpkgs repository</a>. At least much easier than getting a package into any of the major distributions.</p>
