<p>Imagine a fresh install of your favorite unix-like Desktop. Maybe Ubuntu Linux, a BSD - or most likely MacOS. You log in intending to start a Shell and set up the development environment. Except there is no shell! No <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zsh</code>, no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ksh</code>, not even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/sh</code>! All you have is the <em>Settings App</em> and an <em>App Store</em>.</p>

<p>I honestly can‚Äôt imagine that scenario. What is kinda ‚Äúby design‚Äù in the Windows world feels like a car without steering wheel in the Unix World.</p>

<p>So no, we don‚Äôt want to get rid of the POSIX shell.</p>

<p>However the shell is not really a pleasure to work with either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <em>lot</em> of quoting to prevent the rarely used implicit globbing and splitting</li>
  <li>The (arguably mostly extended) <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html">parameter expansions</a> so unintuitive they could attract <a href="https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/raku-a-language-for-gremlins/">gremlins</a>.</li>
  <li>3 overlapping ways to do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code>s.</li>
  <li>3 ways to do arithmetics.</li>
  <li>Hard to use Error handling with bad defaults.</li>
  <li><em>No ergonomic types!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on!</p>

<p>Yet many people say ‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs <em>just shell</em>‚Äù and ‚Äúit gets the job done ü§∑‚Äù.</p>

<p>But I believe that‚Äôs not true. Shell can be nice and easy to work with. I believe it‚Äôs just <em>the 40 years of legacy</em> which make POSIX shell and it‚Äôs extensions so hard. <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a> is a good example for a fun shell. Even modern Windows Powershell can be quite nice to work with!</p>

<p>The issue is not that shell is bad. The issue is that we‚Äôre stuck with it.</p>

<p>But why? Can‚Äôt we just replace it with something nice?</p>

<h2 id="the-simple-way">The simple way</h2>

<p>A very simple way to escape the legacy of the unix shell could be to just replace it with configfiles.</p>

<p>Systemd, the typical continuous integration tool, Kubernetes or Ansible are examples of this approach. It‚Äôs usually <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yaml</code> coupled with some kind of templating language which is either Turing complete or annoyingly rigid.</p>

<p>Ironically more often than not these config files contain <em>some lines of shell</em> - which kinda defeats the point! And brings me to the next point.</p>

<h2 id="the-viral-infection">The viral infection</h2>

<p>Shell is like herpes. You might not see it, but you got it.</p>

<p>Let me give you a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefiles</code> call shell</li>
  <li>Docker <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RUN</code> is shell</li>
  <li>Almost every package manager definition <em>is</em> shell (Alpine, Gentoo, ‚Ä¶) or <em>uses</em> it either indirectly with e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Makefiles</code> (deb based) or directly (rpm based, nix, ‚Ä¶)</li>
  <li>cron (but you should use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-timers</code> instead!)</li>
  <li>SysVInit (Hello Devuan)</li>
  <li>Of course every file with the proper shebang, pre/post scripts, custom OS Hooks, a lot of OS automation‚Ä¶</li>
</ul>

<p>The shell is embedded in the System!</p>

<p>These things could be rewritten to not rely on POSIX Shell anymore and use something like Nushell (or Python, JS, whatever). But if we‚Äôre rewriting 30-40 years of Unix OS building blocks we could also come up with a new and modern kernel that doesn‚Äôt rely on outdated APIs like exit codes as errors. Passing objects between processes instead of string arguments? That would make a new shell language fun! (Hello Powershell)</p>

<p>Apart from that, the one thing POSIX brings us is a common denominator. All Unixes use roughly the same thing. If every distro starts using a different shell, we‚Äôd be back to the 80ies when people were fighting over C-shell and Ksh/Bash/Zsh (which later got standardized in POSIX).</p>

<p><em>Just replacing</em> the POSIX shell suddenly isn‚Äôt such a good plan anymore for getting rid of it.</p>

<h2 id="changing-posix">Changing POSIX</h2>

<p>We could try to fix all the footguns in POSIX itself. But I don‚Äôt know. I mean coming up with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-print0</code><a href="https://blog.toast.cafe/posix2024-xcu#the-null-option">in the 2024 standard</a> - something implemented a long time ago by gnu find‚Ä¶</p>

<p>It <em>might</em> work. But we would still need to figure out how to properly fix the language. It would then take <em>ages</em> to get into POSIX - <em>if</em> it gets accepted. I‚Äôm not that patient!</p>

<p>Is there a way to approach it a bit more efficiently?</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-the-big-players">Learning from the big players</h2>

<p>So we‚Äôre not <em>replacing</em> our beloved POSIX-shell, nor are we fixing the standard. How about just removing the bad parts and ‚Äúcleaning up‚Äù the language in our own implementation?</p>

<p>We just need to somehow get people to use our shell. ü§î</p>

<p>Luckily there‚Äôs a proven way how the big players - at least Microsoft - usually take over existing standards and make them their own!
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a> is a tool of the greedy. But maybe it can be used for the good as well?</p>

<p>We‚Äôre not trying to fuck people over, we just want to <em>extend</em> the shell (with safe and sane features) and we want to <em>extinguish</em> the unmaintainable footguns!</p>

<p>At some point it might make sense to come up with a POSIX alternative standard for our shell. But Bash is a good example that being POSIX compatible is apparently already enough for many people to adopt it.</p>

<h2 id="embrace">Embrace</h2>

<p>So let‚Äôs start by reimplementing it then, like Microsoft would. And since we‚Äôre at it let‚Äôs also implement Bash because it is a bit of a defacto-standard.</p>

<p>In reality this would be extremely hard.</p>

<p>But in a hypothetical world this is super easy. Let‚Äôs just pretend aaand‚Ä¶ <strong>DONE</strong>!</p>

<h2 id="extend">Extend</h2>

<p>While Microsoft usually extends the product, standard, or protocol in a proprietary way completely unmaintainable, incompatible and unusable for OSS, we kinda try to do the opposite. We want to make shell <em>easier</em> to understand and use.</p>

<p>Anyway, <em>how</em> do we extend it?</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>

<p>The first and probably easiest improvement is to give a bit better error messages than bash. Since bash/shell does a really bad job at this, it‚Äôs probably not hard to improve the situation. It might also be a good argument to tell people to start using my new shell!</p>

<p>‚ÄúBash but more helpful‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound bad for a start, right?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Bad
$ if something;; fi
bash: syntax error near unexpected token ';;'

# Something like this is already much better!
$ if something;; fi
if something;; fi
             ^~
Expected word "then", got ";"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>POSIX and even more so Bash shell variables are crap. there are roughly speaking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>strings</li>
  <li>integers which are actually strings</li>
  <li>bad arrays which are actually strings</li>
  <li>worse associative arrays which are actually strings</li>
  <li>errors which are actually integers are actually strings</li>
</ul>

<p>So we want our own <em>types</em>. We just need to define (and use) them somehow.</p>

<p>Remember we can‚Äôt <em>break</em> shell syntax, we just <em>extend</em> it. Therefore suddenly using normal things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myvar = 5</code> to create typed variables won‚Äôt work. A POSIX shell would think <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">myvar</code> is a command. What if a user wants to print out the files <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5</code>? <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat = 5</code>. Ooops our shell can‚Äôt do that - the user got a variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat</code> instead!</p>

<p>So instead of having variable definitions and commands fight each other, let‚Äôs just create a single command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> to define a variable. That also matches the ‚Äúcommand argument‚Äù philosophy where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code> is the command.</p>

<p>But it doesn‚Äôt take string arguments like we‚Äôre used to from shell. It takes a ‚Äúnewly invented‚Äù (read ‚Äústolen from any sane programming language‚Äù) <em>expression syntax</em>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Strings *need* to be quoted now!
var mystring = "hello world!"
# Floats! Take that, POSIX!
var myvar = 3.826482
# since strings have to be quoted
# we don't need `$` to specify vars in our new expression mode!
var mylist = [ 1, 2, "hello", [ "nested"], myvar ]
# Dicts
var ainurs = {
  Melkor: 'He who rises in might',
  Manwe: 'The blessed one'
}

# booleans, bit operators... whatever the others have!
var mybool = myvar + mylist[0] &gt; (1 &lt;&lt; 2)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="control-flow">Control Flow</h3>

<p>We have the expressions, but how can we use them <em>without</em> breaking our shell?</p>

<p>Interestingly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if ( ... ) { ... }</code> is a <em>syntax error</em> in bash. Because it‚Äôs missing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">; then</code> (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fi</code>).</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<p>We can use what all the other languages use. That will also immediately tell people ‚Äúwe‚Äôre using an awesome modern shell here ;)‚Äú.</p>

<p>And the best: We can do the same for while and for loops!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>while (myvar &lt; 9000) {
  var myvar += 1
  echo "So much work! But already $myvar"
}
if (myvar &gt; 9000) {
  echo "IT'S OVER NINE THOUSAND!!!"
}
# nope. bash will never have something remotely looking like this!
for ainur, translation in (ainurs) {
  echo "$ainur translates to '$translation'"
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This already feels a lot more like Python or Javascript to me.</p>

<h3 id="interpolation">Interpolation</h3>

<p>Now shell has a <em>lot</em> of strings. Everything after a command is a string. And almost every line is a command (followed by strings).</p>

<p>Fun sidestory:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Thompson shell - the first unix shell - had exactly 6 ‚Äúbuiltin‚Äù commands. Even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> was an <em>external</em> command. So not only was <em>every</em> letter part of a command or string, 99.2% of all lines were <em>external files</em> being executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyway, we want our sexy data types in these strings. Let our nice expressions &amp; strings do some kissing!</p>

<p>Numbers (and strings, lol) are easy. We just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">‚Äú$what $we $already $now‚Äù</code>.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs just lists &amp; dict‚Äôs that don‚Äôt work‚Ä¶ ü§î</p>

<p>We could do automatic serialization. Always present them as json or something. But that‚Äôs not flexible!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs ignore these two for now and just try to get <em>expressions which return a string</em> working. something <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"like $(echo THIS BUT WITH EXPRESSIONS)"</code>.</p>

<p>‚Ä¶
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$[]</code> syntax is still unused in shell and up for sale?
<em>SOLD OUT!</em></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Why not introduce a fancy way of creating string-only lists?
# POSIX can split. So can we!
# Expression mode is our land of freedom.
var ex = :| Just just just |
# same as ["Just", "just", "just"]

echo "$[ex[0]] as long as we $[ex[1]] get a string, expressions $[ex[3]] work this way"
# ah, so sexy. dot operator for dict elements. I'm Lovin' it!
echo "Hi, I am $[ainurs.Melkor]"

echo "$num1 + $num2 = $[num1 + num2]"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="functions-1">Functions 1</h3>

<p>Now to the other problem. We need a way to transform our lists and dicts into strings.</p>

<p>Maybe shell functions?</p>

<p>There are many things wrong with them, though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>they only take positional arguments</li>
  <li>These arguments are only strings</li>
  <li>
    <p>They can only return data in 3 weird ways:</p>
  </li>
  <li>echo to stdout/stderr</li>
  <li>an exit code</li>
  <li>
    <p>‚Äúleaking‚Äù variables by setting global variables or using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nameref</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>They are not <em>scoped</em> by default, so variables not pretended by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">local</code> are always global.</li>
</ul>

<p>Though parts of this (positionals, exit code, stdout/stderr) are not shells fault! This is just the Unix process interface. Maybe it makes sense if we keep this - in the end that‚Äôs what allows us to simply <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipe | things | around</code>!</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start off by fixing the problems but still keep the ‚Äúlinux subprocess interface‚Äù somehow. It‚Äôs always good to be able to e.g. wrap an external command (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls() { sl; }</code> :).</p>

<p>So our ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù still-linuxy function will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>take positional strings</li>
  <li>use stdout/stderr and allow io redirections with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">| &gt; &lt;</code>, etc.</li>
  <li>return an exit code</li>
  <li>be properly scoped</li>
</ul>

<p>And just because we can, let‚Äôs dream a bit. It should also:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>take optional typed arguments</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>positional and named</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>just for the fun (and üí∏), let‚Äôs also pass <em>blocks of code</em> to our function. That might turn out to be useful, you‚Äôll see.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I think that may work. Like with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var</code>, we pretend that no one ever wants a command called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc</code> and use that.</p>

<p>We will define our procs in a way they can be called with simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mycommand arg1 arg2</code>. But we want optional typed data as well‚Ä¶ ü§î</p>

<p>In the past we have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPRESSIONS</code> inside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$[]</code> (which <em>returns a string</em> so that doesn‚Äôt work), after the pattern <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var X =</code> and inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code>  in control flow‚Ä¶ So the kinda obvious pick would be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mycommand string arguments (my, typed, data)</code>.</p>

<p>What happens if the user wants to pass 3 strings <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(my</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">typed,</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data)</code>? I guess <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mycommand "(my," typed, data)</code> would work! A little sacrifice for a big improvement. Quoting strings in shell is done unnecessarily often anyway.</p>

<p>Moving on to the definition of a proc. We‚Äôre to define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc</code>s how we want. We <em>own</em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc</code> now!</p>

<p>So incorporating everything, a proc can be defined like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>proc myproc (stringy, argument, list;
            positional, typed, args;
            named, typed, args;
            block) {
  echo "$typed, $argument, $[NAMED[0]]"
  echo "$stringy" &gt;&amp;2
  # looking scary, but it's actually not :)
  # our builtin taking a "block"
  eval (block)

  return 0
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The different kinds of arguments are seperated by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> and of course everything is optional. So we can do stuff like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>proc cddo (path;;block) {
  # we could use the "old style" x=$()
  var oldpw = $(pwd)
  cd "$path"
  eval (block)
}

# Sexy, isn't it?
cddo / { rm -rf * }

proc yoda-three (;mylist) {
  echo $[myllist[2]] $[myllist[1]] $[myllist[0]]
}

var l = :|shell is awesome|
yoda-three (l)

proc legacy (name, quote) {
  echo "and $name shall speak!"
  cowsay $quote
}
legacy "Eru" "You shall sing the song of the shell"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> seem confusing but it you‚Äôll get used to it.</p>

<h3 id="functions-2">Functions 2</h3>

<p>Phu, that took a bit of time‚Ä¶ But let‚Äôs get to the other part.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now to the other problem. We need a way to transform our lists and dicts into strings.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember? The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proc</code> didn‚Äôt really get there‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt even come up with a reasonable example for typed data in a proc! So let‚Äôs do something <em>with typed data</em>. Like all the other languages.</p>

<p>We still have our expression mode, in which any unquoted word can only be a variable right now. Why not allow functions there as well? We only need another word to <em>define</em> them‚Ä¶
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">func</code> is ALSO still free!</p>

<p>Shell is really easy to extend.</p>

<p>So nothing special there I guess, functions like in any other language:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Nothing new if you know any popular "C-like" language
func join(list, sep=" ") {
  var x = ""
  for i in (list) {
    # concatenation is with ++ :)
    var x = x ++ sep ++ i
  }
  return (x)
}
var something = [
  "hello", 5, "worlds!"
]
echo "$[join(something, "-")]"
# even better. =&gt; to chain.
# Some of these funcs could be builtin!
echo $[something=&gt;join()=&gt;upper()=&gt;trim()]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will allow us to write proper functions to play with data.</p>

<p>I think it‚Äôs reasonable to specify that dicts &amp; arrays are passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">procs</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funcs</code><em>by reference</em> while strings &amp; scalars are copied.</p>

<h3 id="expressions-to-throw-away">Expressions to throw away</h3>

<p>OK let‚Äôs quickly recall the places where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EXPRESSIONS</code> take place and what result is expected:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># whatever is returned will be stored in x
var x = EXPRESSION
func (x=EXPRESSION) { }

# Needs to be (convertable to) a string
echo $[EXPRESSION]

# Will be converted to a bool
# Everything converts to true except empty str/array/dict, 0 and `null`
if (EXPRESSION) { }
while (EXPRESSION) { }

# Wants a dict/list
for x, y, z in (EXPRESSION) { }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But is that enough?</p>

<p>What if we create a function which has a sideeffect but does NOT return anything? Or for debugging?</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs use up just two more ‚Äúwords‚Äù <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">call</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># run expression and throw away result
call EXPRESSION
call myarray =&gt; append('elem')
call myarray =&gt; sendtoServer()
# Let's throw away the last element
call myarray =&gt; pop()

# print out the return value on the prompt!
= EXPRESSION
= 5 + 5
# =&gt; (Int) 10
= {a: 5} =&gt; toJson()
# =&gt; (Str) "{'a':5}"
= :|some words| =&gt; append\('more')
# =&gt; (Null) null
# (it has a sideeffect but returns nothing)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I think that‚Äôs about it with our extensions for the moment. Of course there‚Äôs a lot more that <em>could</em> be done. But let‚Äôs instead focus on the next part, how do we <em>get rid of legacy code</em>?</p>

<h2 id="extinguish">Extinguish</h2>

<p>So let us remove all the stuff from the language that we replaced:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>var=value
if ...; then ... fi
for ...; do ... done
while ...; do ... done
[[ ... ]]
[ ... ]
((SHELL EXPRESSION))
$((SHELL EXPRESSION))
let "SHELL EXPRESSION"
${variableEXPANSION}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How can we get rid of it while still being somewhat Bash/POSIX compliant?</p>

<p>As Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory would put it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to Fun With Flags!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shell already has a bunch of flags to enable/disable stuff. And even normal Beings sometimes use this ‚ÄúYou need it or your script will kill you‚Äù-idiom:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set -eo pipefail
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It sets two flags: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">errexit</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pipefail</code> - exit if a command fails and a pipeline fails if any of its commands fail (not just the last). Sometimes an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">u</code> is squeezed in between the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eo</code> to fail on undefined variables but you don‚Äôt really see the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html">other flags</a>.</p>

<p>Bash also has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shopt</code> to manage the flag stuff a bit more convenient. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shopt</code> is capable of printing out only a single flag and it‚Äôs value, or give an appropriate exit status depending on a flag being set or not. It can also set some additional flags POSIX doesn‚Äôt know about.</p>

<p>With the funcrionality already built-in, we can just come up with 2 new flags:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>newshell:upgrade # enable new features
newshell:full # disable the legacy ways
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we can do a nice trick used by <a href="https://busybox.net/FAQ.html#getting_started">busybox</a> to get properly rid of bash/POSIX/etc: Symlinks.</p>

<p>We have our binary installed at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/newshell</code> and create a symlink <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash -&gt; newshell</code>. Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/bash</code> will run <em>our newshell</em>. Of course without the above mentioned flags enabled. But if we run directly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/newshell</code> these flags will be set! The same can be done for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/sh</code> to get rid of POSIX shells on my system as well.</p>

<p>Now we can go into any shell script, add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shopt -s newshell:upgrade</code> to start using our new fancy things.</p>

<p>Once all the old crap is gone we can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shopt -s newshell:all</code> to stop ourselfs from falling into old patterns - or we change the shebang to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#!/bin/newshell</code> where we enable the flags by default.</p>

<h2 id="lets-do-it">Let‚Äôs do it?!</h2>

<p>Now you might say ‚Äúcool, but this is a $#@-load of work!‚Äù.</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also possible that you already guessed it: I just showed you the basics of <a href="https://oilshell.org/">Oils</a>!</p>

<p>So instead of dreaming, you can check out the project, install Oils, run Osh and start upgrading to Ysh!</p>

<p>A few important notes though:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôm not the author of Oils. I‚Äôm just a sysadmin and <em>super glad</em> that Andy Chu started this project around 2016</li>
  <li>
    <p>I simplified some parts, <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.23.0/doc/options.html">especially <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flags</code></a>. In reality many changes can be turned on and off individually (see also the <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Gradually-Upgrading-Shell-to-YSH">gradual update docs</a>)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Oils also goes <em>much further</em>, e.g. disabling generally bad shell things that can be done better without new concepts. So just using the flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strict:all</code> can help make a POSIX script better without giving up compatibility!</li>
  <li>Setting the flag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ysh:upgrade</code><a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.23.0/doc/upgrade-breakage.html">actually disables a few things</a>
</li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ysh:all</code> is subject to change and enables some things, but does NOT (yet) disable the things I said. It‚Äôs planned but low prio right now.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Errors do look a bit differerent and are currently not always that nice. But it‚Äôs mainly missing <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.23.0/doc/error-catalog.html#how-to-contribute">feedback/contributions</a> and will become better over time</li>
  <li>
    <p>There are a few more things to <a href="http://www.oilshell.org/release/0.23.0/doc/proc-func.html">proc and funcs</a> than I mentioned</p>
